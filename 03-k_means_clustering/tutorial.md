## Key points
- unsupervized learning
- uses of clustering
- how does it work?
- how to choose a K?
- clustering on the Iris Dataset
- **NO** clustering on image pixel data - *data not suited for k-means clustering*
- **NEEDS MORE RESEARCH** feature engineering
- different runs, different results
- **NEEDS MORE RESEARCH** what is validation

## TODOS:
- find a suitable dataset (*IRIS might be one*)
- implementation: choose a K
- implementation: clustering with chosen K
- save `matplotlib` plots
- use *Key points* structure to write tutorial text
- clustering on image pixel data?
